LED-Top-Hat
===========

This is the code for the LED Top hat which I built for Burning Man 2014.

It's designed to run on a Teensy3.1 with an Adafruit Electret microphone amp (MAX4466) and 5 metres of LPD8806 48LED/m strips.

The strips are cut into 8 rows of 30 LEDs and laid out in a serpentine/S shaped pattern, meaning LED 0 is the top left corner, and 239 is the bottom right. 

Much of this code was borrowed/stolen/based on code found all over the internet, including but not limited to:

 * https://learn.adafruit.com/fft-fun-with-fourier-transforms/overview-1
 * http://bochovj.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/bass-detection-with-arduino/
 * http://www.enviral-design.com/704-leds-the-all-seeing-eye-rgb-led-abstract-top-hat/
 * http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/runningAverage
 * the Strandtest example sketch from the LPD8806 library.
 * and the amazing community at http://fastled.io/+

Apologies for errors and for the terrible code... I'm really not a developer, but enough people wanted to see the code that I'm making it publically available here.

If you end up using it somehow, please let me know!
